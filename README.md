# Pewlett Hackard Silver Tsunami

The purpose of looking at the looming "Silver Tsunami" that Pewlett Hackard is to determine what potential impact the slew of retiring employees will have on the company compared to the amount of up and comers who could potentially fill the void of those retiring.

## Results

In the near future, Pewlett Hackard is looking at over 90k employees across various roles that are coming up on their retirement.  This set of employees is defined as those born between 1952-1955.  In particular, over 62k of them are at a lead or supervisory level.

In comparison, there is a very small set of employees eligible to be mentored to fill these roles.  Of employees born in 1965 (10 years out from retirement), they only have a shade over 800 employees who are at the lead or supervisory level.

## Summary

As mentioned above, there are over 90k roles that will need to be replaced in the next three years due to employees retiring.

The number of employees in the mentorship stage is far below (60 times) what Pewlett Hackard needs to fulfill the roles that will be vacated due to employees retiring.

Even after expanding the birth date window from 1965 to 1965 through 1970, there is no change in the number of employees who could potentially be ready to fulfill the void in lead or supervisory roles that is looming.  This is a sign that the retiring group did a poor job in retaining talent throughout their early tenure.

There is hope on the way though as there is a significant amount of younger employees who are ready to fill lead and management roles being vacated by soon to retire employees.  Thus, Pewlett Hackard will need to be shift the average age of their lead and management staff significantly younger going forward and hire to backfill accodingly.
